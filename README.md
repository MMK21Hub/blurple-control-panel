# Blurple Control Panel

This is a project that I'm currently working on, but it's not ready to be used yet. You can see what it currently looks like by viewing the demo: <https://asciinema.org/a/474308>

## What is it?

An easy way to manage a bunch of Discord bot accounts, and do stuff with them. It's intended to be very flexible, so you can customise it to your needs. <!-- The possibilities are endless! [Redacted clichÃ©] -->

## What can it do?

- Store accounts in a database
- Nice UI
